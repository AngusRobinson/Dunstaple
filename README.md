# Dunstaple: A simple library for processing musical numerically

This is a work in progress. There is much concrete work to be done to allow it to process all possible inputs, and it is not intended to be maximally efficient.

Most file formats for digital transmission of scores are based around the actual engraving process. This means that the notes, which are the fundamental unit of the music, are dispersed irregularly between visual elements like staves and clefs, and formatting instructions. This library is an attempt to build a format centred around the notes, for easier computation.

My aim in doing this is to provide me with a tool I want to use, but also to increase my own understanding. I intend to use it to apply language modelling techniques to music.

from\_scratch\_dunstaple is the place to start, and I will add more walkthroughs as I go.
